### Lijia Yu



> #### 人之立志，顾不如蜀鄙之僧哉？是故聪与敏，可恃而不可恃也；自恃其聪与敏而不学者，自败者也。昏与庸，可限而不可限也；不自限其昏与庸，而力学不倦者，自力者也。

> #### Don't you want to take a leap of faith? Or become an old man, filled with regret, waiting to die alone.

> #### 人生天地之间，若白驹之过隙，忽然而已。

> #### As you think, so shall you become.

> #### 独立之精神，自由之思想。

> ### The truth was important, a healthy society should never have just one voice.

> #### All knowledge is, in final analysis, history. All sciences are, in the abstract, mathematics. All judgements are, in their rationale, statistics.
